# SFML-Tilemap-Shader
An old tilemap shader written in 2012 to accompany a series of articles published on my blog from November to December 2012.
- [Part 1](https://blog.defence-force.org/index.php?page=articles&ref=T2G_ART4) - What's a Tilemap exactly?
- [Part 2](https://blog.defence-force.org/index.php?page=articles&ref=T2G_ART6) - Conceptual description using pseudo code
- [Part 3](https://blog.defence-force.org/index.php?page=articles&ref=T2G_ART7) - Drawing tilemaps using quads and strips
- [Part 4](https://blog.defence-force.org/index.php?page=articles&ref=T2G_ART8) - From Vertex and index buffers to shading
- [Part 5](https://blog.defence-force.org/index.php?page=articles&ref=T2G_ART9) - A complete working rotating and scaling tilemap using a single sf::sprite

**Disclaimer #1:** I have no idea if this code still works with the current version of [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org)

**Disclaimer #2:** This was my first ever shader, last time I had done graphic rendering was years before when I wrote the engine for VRally 2 on Dreamcast, so don't take the content of the code as an example of how things should be done, it's probably full of horrible things
